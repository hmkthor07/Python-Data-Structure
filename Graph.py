# Undirected Graph
- relationships are 2-way
- Used to model social or computer networks.

Directed Graph 
- Relationships are 1-way.
- Used to model airplane flights or bus routes.

"""
Adjacency List
- List of neighbors stored in each vertex
- Pro : Faster and useds less space for Sparse graphs
- Con : Slower for Dense graphs

Adjacency Matrix
- Matrix of neighbors stored centrally in Graph object.
- Pro : Faster for Dense graphs
- Pro : Simpler for Weighted edges
- Con : uses more space
